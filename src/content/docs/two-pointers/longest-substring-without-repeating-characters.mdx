Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

```txt
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

## Solution

Use two pointers to keep track of the current substring. Use a map to keep track of the last seen index of each character. If the current character is already in the map and the last seen index of the character is greater than or equal to the `left` pointer, move the `left` pointer to the last seen index of the character + 1. Update the last seen index of the character. Update the max length of the substring.

## Implementation

```go
func lengthOfLongestSubstring(s string) int {
	  m := make(map[rune]int)
	  var start, maxLen int

    for end, c := range s {
        val, ok := m[c]
    	  if ok && val >= start {
    		    start = val + 1
    	  }
    	  m[c] = end
    	  // max() requires Go 1.21 or later
    	  maxLen = max(maxLen, end - start + 1)
    }
    return maxLen

}
```

      left = map.get(char) + 1;
    }
    map.set(char, right);

## Pseudocode

1. Create a map to keep track of the last seen index of each character.
2. Create two pointers, `left` and `right` to keep track of the current substring.
3. Loop through the string from left to right.
   1. If the current character is already in the map and the last seen index of the character is greater than or equal to the `left` pointer, move the `left` pointer to the last seen index of the character + 1.
   2. Update the last seen index of the character.
   3. Update the max length of the substring.
4. Return the max length of the substring.
